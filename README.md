This project focuses on the implementation and evaluation of decision functions, specifically utilizing the perceptron algorithm for linearly separable and non-linearly separable data. Additionally, the generalized decision function (GDF) is introduced, with demonstrations for second and third-degree polynomials in both two and three dimensions.

## Perceptron for Linearly and Non-linearly Separable Data:

The perceptron algorithm is applied to linearly separable data with perfect accuracy and extended to handle non-linearly separable data, showcasing its limitations in achieving optimal classification accuracy.

## Generalized Decision Function (GDF):

GDF formulations for second and third-degree polynomials in two and three dimensions are presented.
The GDFs are implemented and demonstrated, emphasizing their role in capturing complex decision boundaries beyond linear separability.
Observation of Weight Variations:

The impact of changing weights on the GDFs is explored, illustrating how adjustments to individual weights influence the decision function outcomes.
Different weight configurations are tested for second and third-degree GDFs, showcasing the sensitivity of the models to weight changes.
Conclusion:

The perceptron algorithm is effective for linearly separable data but shows limitations for non-linearly separable cases, emphasizing the need for advanced techniques in such scenarios.
The introduction of GDFs allows for the representation of decision boundaries beyond linear relationships, offering flexibility in capturing more intricate patterns in the data.
Observations of weight variations highlight the sensitivity of decision functions to individual weights, underscoring the importance of careful weight tuning in achieving optimal model performance.


In conclusion, this project provides a comprehensive exploration of decision functions, from the basic perceptron algorithm to the more versatile generalized decision functions, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and sensitivity to weight variations in different dimensional spaces.
